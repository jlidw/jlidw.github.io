Currently I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), advised by Professor [Lei Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~leichen/). 
Prior to that, I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Information Technology from HKUST in 2018 and the B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Jinan University (JNU)](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in 2017.
